Since 1993, we’ve relied on our Engineering DNA to underpin our work with clients,  
leading to major innovations, digital transformations and business results.  
In that time, we’ve expanded geographically, as well as extended our core engineering  
capabilities to include business consulting, design and physical product development.  
  
We’ve been at the forefront of some of the most exciting technology-led transformations  
in the industry, and our story continues into today’s modern age of agile delivery, big data,  
machine learning and AI.
